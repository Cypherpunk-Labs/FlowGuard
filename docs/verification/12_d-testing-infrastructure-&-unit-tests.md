I have the following verification comments after thorough review and exploration of the codebase. Implement the comments by following the instructions in the comments verbatim.

## Comment 1: Key unit tests still missing: TypeScriptAnalyzer, FileScanner, VerificationEngine, GitHub/GitLab adapters.

**Full Review Thread Context:** Original comment flagged missing storage CRUD/planning (SpecGen/TickGen/Workflow/codebase/diagrams/templates)/verification (SpecMatcher/SeverityRater/Feedback/VerificationEngine/adapters) tests. Subsequent discussions tracked partial progress: models/fileSystem/Clarification/TicketValidator/DiffAnalyzer → added storage CRUD/EpicMetadata/SpecGen/TickGen/Mermaid/SpecMatcher/SeverityRater → current state with Workflow/CodebaseExplorer/TicketTemplates/FeedbackGenerator/GitDiffAdapter added, but TypeScriptAnalyzer/FileScanner/VerificationEngine/GitHubAdapter/GitLabAdapter still absent. **Root Cause:** Incomplete test coverage for planning codebase analysis (TS parsing/file scanning) and verification orchestration/adapters leaves key paths untested, risking regressions in spec generation, ticket breakdown, diff verification. **Complete Solution:** 1. **Planning Codebase:** `tests/unit/planning/codebase/TypeScriptAnalyzer.test.ts` - mock TS Compiler API, test symbol extraction (classes/functions/interfaces), import/export analysis, type info. `FileScanner.test.ts` - test glob scanning, .gitignore respect, file filtering by extension/performance. Integrate with `CodebaseExplorer.test.ts` (mock these deps). 2. **Verification:** `VerificationEngine.test.ts` - E2E workflow integrating DiffAnalyzer/SpecMatcher/SeverityRater/FeedbackGenerator; test diff→analysis→matching→rating→feedback→summary/approval. Mock LLM/FS. `adapters/GitHubAdapter.test.ts` - parse PR API JSON, extract changes/metadata. `GitLabAdapter.test.ts` - parse MR API, handle renamed paths. 3. **Utils:** Add `tests/utils/assertions.ts` - custom matchers `toBeValidSpec()`, `toMatchSpecRequirement()`, `toHaveValidFrontmatter()`. 4. **Coverage:** Run `npm run test:coverage`; add tests until `src/**/*.ts` hits 60% (statements/branches/functions/lines). Mock consistently (`createMockLLMProvider`, `createTestEpic`). **Bigger Picture:** Completes testing pyramid: models (shape/validate) → storage (CRUD) → engines (planning/verification behavior). Ensures determinism/isolation via mocks. Aligns with Jest config (`@/` paths, 60% threshold). **Validate:** All tests pass (`npm test`), coverage report >=60%, no LSP errors.
