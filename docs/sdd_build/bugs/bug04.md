When using the tutorial on step 2 of 5, it references: Use the command palette to run "FlowGuard: Create Specification" 
However this command does not exist, so unable to follow the tutorial.

If I use the sidebar to create a spec, it behaves differently than from command pallete.

Once a spec is created, it is empty, with some icons in the header, I cannot write any text. 

I don't see any LLM integration, I want to configure the LLM options via a config file. 

When i clicked in the sidebar, in the ticket section, create ticket i get: ⚠
Failed to serialize frontmatter: unacceptable kind of an object to dump [object Undefined]

When I click the plus symbol to create ticket, after folloing the prompts, i get: Failed to create ticket: Failed to serialize frontmatter: unacceptable kind of an object to dump [object Undefined]
